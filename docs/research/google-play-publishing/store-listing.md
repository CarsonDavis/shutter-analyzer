```
Shutter Analyzer measures the actual shutter speeds of vintage film cameras by analyzing slow-motion video recordings from your phone.

HOW IT WORKS

1. Record your camera's shutter firing in slow-motion (240fps recommended)
2. Import the video into Shutter Analyzer
3. Get precise measurements of each shutter actuation

The app detects brightness changes frame-by-frame to determine exactly how long your shutter stays open. Compare measured speeds against your camera's dial settings to verify accuracy or diagnose timing issues.

PERFECT FOR

- Film photographers testing vintage cameras before purchase
- Camera repair technicians verifying shutter calibration
- Collectors documenting the condition of mechanical cameras
- Anyone curious about their old camera's actual performance

KEY FEATURES

- Analyzes any slow-motion video (120fps, 240fps, or higher)
- Detects multiple shutter firings in a single video
- Calculates percentage error from expected speeds
- Works with any camera that has a visible shutter (leaf or focal plane)
- No special hardware required - just your phone's slow-motion camera

SUPPORTED VIDEO FORMATS

MP4, MOV, and other common video formats. Works best with slow-motion video at 240fps for accurate sub-millisecond measurements.

ACCURACY

At 240fps, each frame represents approximately 4.2 milliseconds. The app uses sub-frame brightness weighting to achieve even greater precision, making it suitable for testing speeds from 1 second down to 1/500th of a second or faster.

HOW TO GET THE BEST RESULTS

- Use a bright, even light source behind the shutter
- Keep your phone steady on a tripod
- Record in slow-motion mode (Settings > Camera > Slow Motion)
- Fire the shutter at each speed setting you want to test

NO INTERNET REQUIRED

All video processing happens locally on your device. Your videos never leave your phone.

OPEN SOURCE

Based on the open-source Shutter Analyzer project. Visit our GitHub for the desktop Python version and technical documentation.
